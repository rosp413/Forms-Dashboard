The Assistance is granted to a Research Scholar through his/her faculty supervisor. The norms approved are as follows.\n\nN1:\nSupport would be granted according to Scheme G1 or Scheme G2 described below. Most Research Scholars/Project Staff would be granted support according to Scheme G1; some selected categories of Research Scholars would be granted support according to Scheme G2, based on the consideration that those categories of Research Scholars are also expected to seek support from their parent organizations. The description following G2 includes a mention of which Research Scholars are marked out for support as in G2. Project staff would normally be considered for support according to Scheme G1. If that is not feasible due to unavailability of sufficient funds or for other reasons, then support for them according to Scheme G2 shall be considered.\n\nSchemes G1 and G2 for Support:\n\nScheme G1 : This is applicable for all Research Scholars except those listed under the Scheme G2 below, as also to most project staff as explained in Norm N1 above. The Support granted would be as follows:\nFor conferences/workshops/symposia organized within :\n     a) Group A : North America, Australia, South America, New Zealand: Rs. 2,20,000/-\n     b) Group B : Europe, Far-East Asia, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Indonesia, Africa: Rs. 1,70,000/-\n     c) Group C : Neighbouring Countries, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Burma, Pakistan, Gulf Countries, Singapore, Malaysia,                          Thailand, Maldives: Rs. 1,20,000/-\n\nScheme G2 : This is applicable only to Research Scholars belonging to the Sponsored (SW) and College Teacher (CT) Categories, not normally resident on campus. It is also applicable to project staff, only when they cannot be granted support according to Scheme G1 for one or more reason(s).\nFor conferences/workshops/symposia organized within :\n     a) Group A : North America, Australia, South America, New Zealand: Rs. 1,10,000/-\n     b) Group B : Europe, Far-East Asia, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Indonesia, Africa: Rs. 85,000/-\n     c) Group C : Neighbouring Countries, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Burma, Pakistan, Gulf Countries, Singapore, Malaysia, \t\t  Thailand, Maldives: Rs. 60,000/-\n\nThe above amounts are inclusive of the following:\n     i)   Travel\n     ii)  Registration fees\n     iii) DA (including local travel, food bills and local stay as given below)\n\nMaximum admissible DA rates are given in Table below:");
